            <h1>Unsung Heroes of the World- Women</h1>
            <h3>
                As it is rightly said, "Behind the success of every man, is a woman."
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are many things that are unknown to most of us. Women are
                generally marginalized and moved to the fringes of the society.But we
                know that marginalization is a wrong thing to do, by the standards of
                both law, and our conscience. With the help of awareness raising
                programs, the current generation is trying to wipe these stereotypical
                beliefs out and bring women back to glory. But unbeknownst to most of
                us, women have had to endure a silent pain, the pain of sacrifice!
                Here, we will be looking at some famous, and not so famous women and
                also understand why (in my opinion), they are considered as one of the
                marginalized groups of the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                An adult human female is generally called a "woman". Their gender is
                denoted by the symbol ♀ of Venus. An astounding fact is that the
                planet "Venus", named after the Roman goddess of beauty and love, is
                the only planet named after a female! A woman is called a "girl"
                before she reaches the age of adulthood (generally considered as 18
                years of age). Women are an integral part of the society. They need to
                be safeguarded and assissted for the society to progress in its
                development. Any society that discriminates against women is
                considered to be under-developed or not at all developed.
            </p>

                Women have had a role to play since the ancient times. There are many
                women who have fought bravely on the battlefield of war and also in
                the societal battlefield against gender discrimination. We will be
                looking at a few women who were/are not so famous, but make/made an impact on the world.
